TLDR; The official WebXR Demo Instance is down.
GraphWiz now hosts a private version of it:

Mozilla’s immersive WebXR experience, designed to introduce newcomers to the world of Virtual Reality, is now hosted by GraphWiz. The experience is accessible via a single click from a WebXR-enabled browser. The application represents a significant advancement in VR accessibility. It utilizes the WebXR technology, a collaborative effort from a consortium including Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla, among other industry leaders. This cutting-edge interface replaces the outdated WebVR 1.1 standard, which suffered from various limitations and was restricted to Virtual Reality applications. By taking over hosting, GraphWiz Solutions ensures continued access to this crucial tool for exploring the potential of VR technology. This move underscores GraphWiz Solutions’ commitment to supporting open-source initiatives and fostering innovation within the XR ecosystem.
