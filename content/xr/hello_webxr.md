This immersive WebXR experience is designed to introduce newcomers to the world of Virtual Reality. The experience is accessible via a single click from a WebXR-enabled browser. The application represents a good demonstration for comfortable VR accessibility. It utilizes the WebXR technology, a collaborative effort from a consortium including Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla, among other industry leaders. This interface replaces the outdated WebVR 1.1 standard, which suffered from various limitations and was restricted to Virtual Reality applications. By taking over hosting, we ensure continued access to this innovative showcase for exploring the potential of VR technology. We are committed to supporting open-source initiatives and fostering innovation within the XR ecosystem.
